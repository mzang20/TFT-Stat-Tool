TFT Stat Tool is a web-based analytics platform designed to help Teamfight Tactics players improve through personalized, data-driven insights not available on popular meta websites. By entering their Riot ID, users can fetch and analyze their recent match history, enabling trend identification over time based on their own gameplay.

The platform computes and visualizes key statistics such as top-performing traits, items, and units based on frequency and placement performance (Top 4 vs Bottom 4). These insights help players identify strengths, weaknesses, and actionable areas for improvement.

Currently in development is an interactive board that allows users to build team comps and receive feedback based on historical performance data. The backend will leverage machine learning techniques including Apriori association mining and deep learning models to suggest high-performing combinations and predict future outcomes.

~~Enter in the example player if unfamiliar with tool. May take a while due to using free Render backend which winds down after no use.~~
